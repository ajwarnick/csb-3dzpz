          As the first land-grant institution established under the 1862 Morrill
          Act, we acknowledge that the state of Kansas is historically home to
          many Native nations, including the
          <a href="http://kawnation.com/?page_id=72">Kaw</a>,
          <a
            href="https://www.osagenation-nsn.gov/who-we-are/historic-preservation"

          <a href="https://www.pawneenation.org/page/home/pawnee-history"
            >Pawnee</a
          >, among others. Furthermore, Kansas is the current home to four
          federally recognized Native nations: The
          <a href="https://www.pbpindiantribe.com/about/"
            >Prairie Band Potawatomie</a
          >, the
          <a href="https://www.ktik-nsn.gov/history/"
            >Kickapoo Tribe of Kansas</a
          >, the
          <a
            href="https://www.iowatribeofkansasandnebraska.com/history-of-the-ioway"

          Many Native nations utilized the western plains of Kansas as their
          hunting grounds, and others – such as the Delaware – were moved
          through this region during Indian removal efforts to make way for
          White settlers. It’s important to acknowledge this, since the land
          that serves as the foundation for this institution was, and still is,
          stolen land.
        </p>
        <p>
          We remember these truths because K-State’s status as a land-grant
          institution is a story that exists within ongoing settler-colonialism,
          and rests on the dispossession of Indigenous peoples and nations from
          their lands. These truths are often invisible to many. The recognition
          that K-State’s history begins and continues through Indigenous
          contexts is essential.

          Exploration of websites design and development through the use of
          web-based tools as a presentation/delivery format. ART 390 is an
          introduction to the methods and processes of designing interactive
          digital interfaces and products. Students will learn basic html, css,
          and javascript, design with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,
          generate site navigational structures, and conduct team-based
          usability research, testing, and presentation of findings. Students
          will also be asked to document their process for solving complex
          digital interaction problems that will be presented throughout the
          semester. Usability and the aesthetics of digital typography are
          emphasized. Course is a six hour lab.

            Assignments are to be completed on time. Each day the project is
            late the grade will be lowered one letter grade. If you feel the
            piece is incomplete, or questionable, bring it to class for
            critique. This class will provide a venue for discussion and your
            fellow students are there for input and guidance. At the time of the
            critique you will receive a grade. If you know you are going to be
            absent make arrangements to hand in the work before critique.

              Any appeal for grades must be brought to the instructor during

            </li>
            <li>
              Incomplete grades (&quot;I&quot;) will only be granted for
              significant events such as the death of a family member during the
              semester or a note from a doctor documenting a hospitalization
              representing a significant period of time.
            </li>
            <li>
              Only if given the final grade of &quot;I&quot; (incomplete) will
              additional work after the conclusion of a semester be accepted.
            </li>

          We will be having a number of critiques during the semester using
          informal, formal, group, and individual formats. Critiques are a
          valuable forum for communication between students and instructor and
          provide an opportunity for everyone to view and learn from each
          other’s work. It is the intent of this course to provide an
          environment in which a lively and rich exchange between students and
          instructor may occur. Therefore, please restrict your comments to
          constructive criticism - show respect at all times for the thoughts
          and efforts of all class participants.

          offices or workspaces. Unvaccinated students, faculty and staff who
          can receive the COVID-19 vaccine are strongly encouraged to do so. The

      </h4>

      <div>
        <p>
          Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on
          personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that,
          in academic matters, one&#39;s work is performed honestly and without
          unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by
          registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity
          System. The policies and procedures of the Honor and Integrity System
          apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and
          graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The
          Honor and Integrity System website can be reached via the following
          URL:
          <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/honor">www.k-state.edu/honor</a>. A
          component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of
          the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or
          other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied,
          whether or not it is stated: &quot;On my honor, as a student, I have
          neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic
          work.&quot; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic
          honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the
          reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

      <h4 id="academic-freedom-statement">Academic Freedom Statement</h4>
      <div>
        <p>
          Kansas State University is a community of students, faculty, and staff
          who work together to discover new knowledge, create new ideas, and
          share the results of their scholarly inquiry with the wider public.
          Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or
          challenge established views, the health and growth of any society
          requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this
          type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&#39;s
          mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit
          of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of
          inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is
          not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research,
          but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social
          and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the
          university community to engage with such issues.

          Your mental health and good relationships are vital to your overall
          well-being. Symptoms of mental health issues may include excessive
          sadness or worry, thoughts of death or self-harm, inability to
          concentrate, lack of motivation, or substance abuse. Although problems
          can occur anytime for anyone, you should pay extra attention to your
          mental health if you are feeling academic or financial stress,
          discrimination, or have experienced a traumatic event, such as loss of
          a friend or family member, sexual assault or other physical or
          emotional abuse.

          as outlined in the Student Governing Association By Laws, Article V,
          Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the
          learning environment may be asked to leave the class.

          Please read the KSU Principles of Community and follow closely:

          I expect that all students in the class will respect their teacher and
          fellow students, and treat each other with understanding and
          tolerance. Discrimination of any form is counter-productive to a
          creative environment. It is also offensive. I stand against any
          discrimination towards anyone in this class, and consequences of such
          behavior will be very negative.
